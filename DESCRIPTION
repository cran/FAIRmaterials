Description: We provide here tools used by the Solar Durability and Lifetime Extension Center (SDLE)
    for FAIRifying data from materials science projects. Functions have been created for numerous tools common
    in the field in order to make the metadata more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible.
